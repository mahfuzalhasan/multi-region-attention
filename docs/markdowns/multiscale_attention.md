## Multi-scale Region Attention

The multi-scale region attention method enhances the attentional feature extraction in transformer models. It achieves this by:

- **Window-based Attention:** Dividing the input feature map into windows allows localized region of interest. But simple window attention on this local regions can not enjoy the broader context (ie inter-window relationship and/or global context)
  
- **Multi-scale Window Approach:** Splitting heads into different window sizes (e.g., head 1 focusing on a small window size, head 2 on a larger window inclusive of several smaller window regions) merges outputs to capture both local and broader context efficiently.

- **Correlation Grouping:** Introducing a mechanism to merge context across different window scales enhances contextual relationships between smaller and larger windows. This merging improves the attentional output by reducing redundant computation over the spatial token space across heads.

This approach empowers models to capture both fine-grained and global information, significantly improving their ability to handle diverse visual features.
